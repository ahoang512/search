# About

I created this script locally using ruby version 2.3.3. After starting the
program, enter 1 and press Enter. Follow the instructions stated to begin the
search. If a search for user is done, it will also include the organization name
(if organization_id exist) as well as the associated tickets. A search for tickets/organization will only show the matching hash.
